Start the Hazelcast Cluster by applying Hazelcast custom resource file `hazelcast.yaml`.
Hazelcast Enterprise requires a license key. If you donâ€™t have a license key, you can request one from the [Hazelcast website](http://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/)
So, please, enter your license key in the CLI:

```plain
kubectl apply -f /root/hazelcast.yaml --wait
kubectl wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Running --timeout=120s hazelcast/hazelcast || kubectl get hazelcasts.hazelcast.com hazelcast -o wide
```
{{exec}}
